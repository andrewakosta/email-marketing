Email Marketing is an open source tool that allows you to load your customer databases from an Excel file and then search for the column 'E-mails' the column should have this name otherwise the program will not renew the email addresses, Once the email addresses are located within the Excel file, you can proceed to create a mail body and then send the message to each email address.
